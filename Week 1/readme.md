### Oreo is a maltipoo, "the Maltipoo is a crossbreed. Opening your heart and home to a crossbreed is like opening a beautifully wrapped package on your birthday: you never know what’s going to be inside. It’s often assumed that a crossbreed will combine the best of two or more breeds, but genetics doesn’t always work that way. The way genes combine and express themselves is not necessarily within a breeder’s control, even less so when two breeds are crossed. That’s something to keep in mind before you lay down lots of money for a dog that you have been assured will be hypoallergenic or healthier than a purebred."

### Miemie is a feline, mixed with Ragdoll and British Shorthair. He is a scottish fold this means he is easy to be unhealthy. I adopted him from Canada.

# Love them!!!
